GAM-DEV Final Project Specs

The game is like Color Bump, but instead of hitting the same colors the player must go thru the gates with the same color as the player. The colors given are blue, beige, green and pink. Each level can have a different color of player that should go into their corresponding gate. The planeâ€™s width is 7 and its height should be more than 30. Use Probuilder to create the plane. There will be 30 levels (10 per member). There will be 10 easy levels, 10 medium levels and 10 hard levels. The hard level should use immersion (the gates should be glowing) and the skybox will be black. The player moves on his own and as level progresses the speed of the player becomes faster.
